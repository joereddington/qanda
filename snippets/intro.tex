\section*{Introduction}
We're going to do another question and answer session today. This time I'd like to focus on the second half of the course but I am happy to take questions from any section of the course, or from any of the recommended readings. 

If you are short of questions, then I suggest: 

\begin{itemize} 
\item looking through previous slides and seeing if there are any parts you don't feel like you `get';
\item looking through past papers and seeing if there are any questions you don't feel like you could answer;
\item asking some of the starter questions.
\end{itemize} 

You can ask questions by putting up your hand or with Teams.  

Particularly interesting questions will be added to the database and may be starter questions for next year.

Here are some randomly generated questions for you to try asking:
